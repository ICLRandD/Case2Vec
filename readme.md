## Credit and acknowledgment

The Tornado web application included in this repository is heavily based on https://github.com/superkerokero/word2vec-search-app. Only minor modifications were made to the original codebase, including minor changes to `server.py`, `index.html` and `ajaxclient.js`. As such, we are very grateful to https://github.com/superkerokero for making the code available.
